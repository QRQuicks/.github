## Getting Started
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

1. Clone this repository:
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/QRQuick.git

3. Open the application and follow the instructions to generate your QR code.
4. Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.

## Usage

Enter the information you want to encode, such as a URL or contact details, and QRQuick will generate a high-quality QR code you can download and use immediately.

## Roadmap
- Tracking & Analytics: QRQuick will soon offer tracking, allowing you to monitor how many times your QR codes are scanned, and where they are scanned from.
